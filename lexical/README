This is a modification of the global model to be fully explicit about
all communications and to rely on Racket's module system entirely.

There are a few things that stink about it:

1 Scripts are still boring functions.

2 make-header has to take an explicit list of types and make-blob has
  to have an explicit list of exports.

  One way to fix this is to wrap define-(type|export|script) into a
  larger form that collects and names these.

3 make-blob produces a Racket data-structure for the map, rather than
  an auxiliary file that can be used over and over.

  I assume this is fine.

4 Scripts have to do explicitly unquote references to
  (type|export|script)s.

  We can deal with this when we solve (1) by making them be phase-1
  bindings.

5 The identifiers of (type|export|script)s all can conflict with
  Racket identifiers. That is, there is one namespace for everything.

  We can deal with this when we make them phase-1 bindings OR when we
  do step 2.
